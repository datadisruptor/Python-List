# Max in lists

So i've seen a youtuber by the name of "Intendly" make a video showing the max() function [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h84_wmhSr3A].
It will return the max value number, which makes sense. 
But in the names list it prints Mario, instead of the name at the end (Carlos), It does this because it prints the names alphabetically.
He then shows that using the len() function (which will return the longest character in the string) which isn't optimal as if you have a random list it would print the name that has the most character (which would be random, and not the last.)

The most optimal way would be to do it as i've posted.

Edit: I've talked with someone to realize that wasn't his idea. He wanted to get the string with the max characters, which makes more sense. Therefore i apologize but will keep this up.
